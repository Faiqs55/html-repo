        A private organization has announced scholarships worth Rs. 5.9 million
        for students at the University of Karachi. The scholarships will be
        awarded to students from five different departments under an agreement
        signed between the university and the sponsoring institution.

        Speaking at the signing ceremony, Vice Chancellor Dr. Khalid Iraqi
        highlighted the challenges facing higher education in Pakistan. He noted
        that only two percent of students nationwide can access higher
        education, largely due to economic pressures.

        Dr. Iraqi said the lack of industrial growth and limited government
        funding for education have further deepened the crisis. Many parents, he
        added, cannot afford to educate their children because of widespread
        unemployment.
      </p>
      <p>
        He called on both the government and the private sector to step forward
        in supporting education.

        The Vice Chancellor also pointed out that Karachi University has
        established alumni-backed scholarships within departments and remains
        the only university in Pakistan with a dedicated Student Admission Fund.
        Last year, Rs10 million was allocated under this fund to help students
        who qualify academically but cannot afford tuition fees.
