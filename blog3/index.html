        The Punjab government is considering a proposal to provide fee relief
        for students from regions hit by recent floods.
      </p>
      <p>
        According to Education Minister Rana Sikandar Hayat, a recommendation
        has been forwarded to the Chief Minister of Punjab to waive registration
        and semester fees for students enrolled in public colleges and
        universities located in flood-affected districts.

        He stated that a final decision will be made once the Chief Minister
        approves. The initiative, he added, would ease the financial burden on
        families struggling due to the disaster.
      </p>
      <p>
        The minister further assured that the government is committed to
        providing all possible support to ensure that students can continue
        their education. He also urged private schools, colleges, and
        universities to extend similar relief measures for affected students.
