        The Higher Education Commission (HEC) has not issued updated rankings of
        Pakistani universities for the past ten years, leaving students and
        parents without official guidance on academic standards.
      </p>
      <p>
        The last rankings were published in 2015, placing Quaid-e-Azam
        University at the top, followed by the University of Punjab in second
        place and the National University of Sciences and Technology (NUST) in
        third. Since then, no fresh list has been released, and the outdated
        2015 rankings remain on official websites.

        Students and parents often depend on HEC rankings to judge the quality
        of higher education institutions. The absence of new data has created
        uncertainty for many seeking reliable information before making
        admission decisions.

        An HEC spokesperson stated that the commission is currently updating the
        rankings and assured that the revised list will be published online once
        the process is complete.
